# CytoUI- Empower your Flow Cytometry Analysis

**Note:** This project was developed during the summer research internship tensure at IIIT Delhi. This project is solely meant for research and is not meant for commercial usage.

## Objectives:

The main objectives of the CytoUI project are:

a. Simplify Flow Cytometry Analysis:
The primary objective of CytoUI is to simplify the analysis of flow cytometry data. By providing a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive set of analysis tools, we aim to reduce the barrier to entry for researchers and clinicians who need to become more familiar with complex data analysis techniques.

b. Enhance Data Visualization:
Effective data visualization is essential for gaining insights from flow cytometry data. CytoUI focuses on providing powerful visualization capabilities, allowing users to explore their data in a visual and interactive manner.


## Features:

Cyto UI is a comprehensive flow cytometry analysis tool designed to simplify analyzing and visualizing FCS (Flow Cytometry Standard) data. It provides a user-friendly web interface and a wide range of features to support researchers and clinicians in their flow cytometry analysis tasks.

The purpose of the Cyto UI library is to streamline the flow cytometry analysis workflow and provide a seamless user experience. It serves as a centralized platform where users can upload their FCS files, perform data extraction and preprocessing, apply various analysis techniques, and visualize the results.

The main features and functionalities of the Cyto UI library include:

**1. Website Landing Page:**
The landing page serves as the entry point to the Cyto UI application. It provides an overview of the tool's capabilities, highlights its key features, and allows users to sign up or log in to access their personalized dashboards.

**2. Login & Signup feature & Authentication:**
Cyto UI offers secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms that have been implemented using NextAuth. Users can create an account, log in using their credentials, and access their personalized dashboards. This ensures data privacy and user-specific functionality.

**3. Dashboard:**
The dashboard provides users with a centralized and personalized view of their flow cytometry analysis projects. It displays relevant information, such as recently uploaded files, ongoing analysis tasks, and saved analysis workflows.

**4. FCS File Extraction:**
Cyto UI enables users to upload FCS files directly to the platform. It performs automatic extraction of the data from the FCS files, allowing users to access and analyze the individual parameters and events within the data.

**5. Canvas:**
The canvas feature provides an interactive workspace where users can visually explore and manipulate their flow cytometry data. It offers functionalities such as zooming, panning, and selecting specific data subsets for further analysis.

**6. Plotting Feature:**
Cyto UI includes a powerful plotting feature that allows users to create customized visualizations of their flow cytometry data. Users can plot scatter plots to analyze parameter distributions and identify patterns or outliers.
These features are implemented using modern web technologies such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS in the front end. The state management is handled using Zustand, providing efficient and reactive data handling. In the backend, FastAPI is used to create robust APIs for various functionalities, while MongoDB serves as the database to store and retrieve user data and analysis results.
The Cyto UI tool offers numerous benefits and advantages for flow cytometry data analysis. It simplifies the analysis process, reduces manual efforts, enhances data visualization, and promotes collaboration and reproducibility. By leveraging the capabilities of Cyto UI, researchers, and clinicians can gain deeper insights into their flow cytometry data, make more informed decisions, and accelerate their research and discovery efforts.
